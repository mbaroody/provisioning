For add-on description, please see [AnkiWeb page](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/231569866)

This add-on is based on the [Anki Fanfare: Gamification](https://github.com/lovac42/Fanfare) add-on

Supported Anki versions: **2.1.36 - 2.1.50+**

# How to customize themes

You can modify existing themes, or create a new theme. Open the add-on config and click 'Open Theme Folder' to find the theme files.

Audiovisual feedback is triggered in 4 situations:
(1) when the review starts,
(2) when you click an answer and do a review,
(3) when you go on the congrats screen (When the review is completed),
(4) When you repeatedly fails cards.

The add-on chooses a file to play/display from folder `start` for (1), and `congrats` for (3). For (2), a file is chosen from `again|hard|good|easy` based on which answer button you pressed.

You can change which images/sounds are played by adding, modifying, or deleting the files in the theme directory.

If you messed up the theme somehow, you can find the original theme files in `addon_folder/default/themes/`.

### Visual Feedback

Images in `images/` isn't actually displayed by default. The visual feedback is controlled by the 4 files `web/(reviewer|congrats).(js|css)`, and many themes just choose to display images in `images/` directory.

On (1), `window.avfReviewStart()` is called. On (2), `window.avfAnswer(ease)` is called where ease is the string `"again"|"hard"|"good"|"easy"`. On (4), `window.avfIntermission()` is called.
You can control the visual effect by declaring those functions in the `web/reviewer.js`.

### Creating a new theme

You can create a new theme by copy-pasting an existing theme directory in `addon_folder/user_files/themes/` directory. (Not in the `addon_folder/default/themes/` directory)
