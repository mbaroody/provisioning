:heart: My heartfelt thanks goes out to everyone who has supported this add-on through their tips, contributions, or any other means (you know who you are!). All of this would not have been possible without you. Thank you for being awesome!

**IMPORTANT**: Releases of the add-on past v1.0.0 are only compatible with Anki 2.1.55 and up. 

If you are on an earlier Anki release there is no need to worry: Copying the AnkiWeb add-on code into Anki will automatically download a compatible version of the add-on for you. However, please be aware that it will not include the latest changes below.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - 2022-12-16

### [Download](https://github.com/glutanimate/speed-focus-mode/releases/tag/v1.0.0)


The changelog below encompasses all changes since the previous AnkiWeb release.

### Added

- Added a **button** that **stops automated events** from firing ("More Time!"). Can be disabled in the new config file.
- Added a **hotkey** that that does the same (configurable, set to `p` by default,  thanks to AnKing for the inspiration)
- Added a simple **countdown**, indicating the time until the next automated card action
- You can now **bury** cards (thanks to NicolasCuri for the inspiration)
- You can now **mark** cards as **"good"** in addition to "again" (thanks to JulyMorning for the feature request)
- Added ability to launch card actions from the question side, skipping the answer reveal (e.g. to bury cards immediately, thanks to Ba for the suggestion)
- Timers are now suspended automatically when opening dialogs
- Timers are now suspended automatically when typing answer

### Changed

- Raised minimum supported version to Anki 2.1.55 in order to conserve development time and prepare for upcoming refactor of Anki's main screen.
- Please note that Anki versions 2.1.45 and above ship with a new deck options screen whose add-on APIs are still not fully set in stone and is thus not viable to support just yet. To access the old deck options and thus Speed Focus Mode's settings, please shift click on the "Options" entry after clicking on the gear icon next to a deck.
- `sound.mp3` files should now be placed in the `user_files` directory to preserve them across add-on updates.
- Some further code refactoring and reorganization to improve maintainability and support with upcoming Anki updates

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue that would cause the add-on to produce an error message when opening the card browser in some scenarios (#38)
- Fixed a compatibility issue with Clickable Tags, AnkiConnect, Review Heatmap, and other add-ons wrapping the dialog manager (#34, #28, #27, #23)
- Dropped support for very old Anki versions. The minimum supported version is now 2.1.22.
- Addressed an issue that would cause the alert not to play in some scenarios
- Added a workaround to make Speed Focus Mode compatible with Advanced Review Bottom Bar
