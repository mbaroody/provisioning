[1] Remove restrictions.(4-25 1sec -> 0.001sec)
    - After discussion, this restriction has been removed.
    - Only a workaround for batch processing will be added.
    - Version restrictions have been removed.
There are often requests for restrictions on cheaters, but so far there is no specific definition of cheaters, so if such restrictions are to be added we need a discussion in the AnkiForums thread before they are added.

2025-04-25
[1] Enhancements
    - added anti cheat measures.
        Reviews need at least 1 second and streaks need more than 0 seconds.
        Grade now was added in Anki25.05 so it is possible that more users will use this.
    - version update  v4.0 -> v5.0

2025-04-17
I added all the missing flags. (Svalbard & Jan Mayen, Ascension Island, Canary Islands, Ceuta & Melilla, St. Helena, Tristan da Cunha, Diego Garcia)

[ Additional explanation of gamification mode ]

- About the new leaderboard
In this update, the leaderboard has been almost completely redesigned to add page change functionality. (Gamification mode only.) These changes allow us to support more users. However there are a lot of internal code changes so it may be a bit bug prone. If you find any problems or missing features, please contact me.

- Safe Mode
The original leaderboard and the new leaderboard work with different code. So if the gamification mode leaderboard does not work for some reason, it is likely that you can use the original leaderboard by turning off the mode. (like safe mode)

[ bottom right of global leaderboard ]

- Mini mode:
Make the gamification mode display as small as possible. Press it once again to restore it.

- Change Sort Option:
Added an option to quickly change the sort of the leaderboard (Review, Time, 31days, Streaks, Retention.You need to restart the leaderboard for the changes to take effect.

[1] Server enhancements
So far the leaderboard is getting about 1000 new users every 1-2 months, so I've upgraded the server to make it about 70 times faster and more efficient. The database has been rebuilt and all data has been moved (Sqlite3->MySQL) This solved the problem of occasional new registrations and the delay problem.

[2] Bug fixes
Fixed a bug that groups are not displayed in web leaderboards.

[3] Enhancements
[ Gamification mode ]
Enhanced gamification with more icons and numerical feedback. If you don't like it, you can disable it at once in the options(Config -?> Oters tab). The code is not optimized yet, so there is a disadvantage for now that it increases the delay before the window is displayed.

[a] Display of yesterday's users:  Added a function to display the scores of users who logged in yesterday and not only today.
Users who logged in today will see a green dot. If you do not like this yesterday, you can optionally disable it (Show only today's users).
[b] Review progress bar: This will reach 100% when the average number of reviews for the month is reached.
[c] Timer Rank: The rank changes by the learning time. Maximum 12 hours.
[d] Streaks tree: A tree grows after one week and can grow up a maximum of 3 years.
[e] 31days orbs and crystals: Colorful orbs and crystals are displayed based on the average number of reviews in the last 31 days. The orb will change color and shape for every 100 reviews, counting in 10 steps until 3000 reviews. After that, the orb counts every 1000 reviews up to a maximum of 10000 reviews.
[f] Weather icon of retention rate: The weather icon changes according to the retention rate.
[g] XP level: Calculates and displays the level from the XP. The blue progress bar indicates the XP required for the next level.

[ Enhanced numerical display ]
[a] Review: Added a function to display seconds in review. The 0-2 seconds/card is indicated by a patlamp. (Since the most common reason reported so far is that the review is too fast.) This function is only for display, so there is no penalty for now. If you are reviewing too fast for some reason, I recommend you to write the reason in Bio. (Because Bio will be displayed when someone reports a user.)
[b] Streaks: The year, month and date are displayed. Added a function that sometimes display cracker or cake by streaks.

[ Other ]
1. Enhanced auto-align function for leaderboards.
2. Moved the league icon to the far left.
